Your BMR Check
The basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the amount of energy you need while resting in a temperate environment during the post-absorptive state, or when you digestive system is inactive. In such a state, Your energy will be...

The following equations are all validated ways of calculating BMR. 

A = age
H = body height in centimeters
W= body weight in kilograms

Revised Harris-Benedict Equation for men: BMR = 13.397W + 4.799H – 5.677A + 88.362
Revised Harris-Benedict Equation for women: BMR = 9.247W + 3.098H – 4.330A + 447.593

From the Your BMR Check, you can see that losing weight also decreases your BMR. This means that the more weight you lose, the less energy (calories) your body needs to maintain homeostasis. This has implications for weight loss strategies.
